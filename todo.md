## Exp 1: start with yolov8n.pt
done

## Exp 2: update model to yolov8s.pt
less accuracy than tolov8n

## Exp 3: use adam optimizer and update learning rate  to 0.001
slightly increased accuracy from exp 1

## Exp 4: use raytune for hyperparameter optimization
only works on mac, not on windows but mac is slow.

## Exp 5: use new best hyperparameters given in yolov8 docs
